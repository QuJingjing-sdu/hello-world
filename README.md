Hi humans!
 
QuJingjing-sdu here, I'm very interested in operational research and machine learning. I'm a PhD student in energy Economics from Shandong University. I majored in mathematics in both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Matlab is the programming software I often use. As for programming languages, I can skillfully use C, C++ and SQL languages. I'm particularly interested in Python right now, and I look forward to learning with you. Thank you!
